# se_interview_questions
Questions that I would ask during an interview to determine if a given SE department is a good fit for my interests

By design, there is some repetition across questions, the goal being to feel out the full-context to a question.  This is consistent with traditional practices surrounding surveys.

## WHAT IS MY IDEAL SE ENVIRONMENT?

1. A healthy codebase that is fairly straightforward to work with. This includes well-structured DRY testing, minimal cruft, sensibly named methods/classes/modules/arguments, etc.
2. The existence and promotion of best-practices/standards such that 1) the codebase may retain its health, 2) SE programming skills are kept sharp.
3. Minimal/non-existent after-hours responsibility for minor code breakage.
4. Strong interfacing between SE's and story stakeholders.
5. Proper distancing between management and story-pointing
6. Management-driven promotion of cruft reduction.
